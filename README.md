<h2>🧐Features</h2>

*   Finds the .fit files from your MyWhoosh installation.
*   Fix the missing power & heart rate averages.
*   Removes the temperature.
*   Create a backup file to a folder you select.
*   Uploads the fixed .fit file to Garmin Connect.

<h2>🛠️ Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Download myWhoosh2Garmin.py to your filesystem to a folder or your choosing.</p>

<p>2. Go to the folder where you downloaded the script in a shell.</p>

- <b>MacOS:</b> Terminal of your choice. 
- <b>Windows:</b> Start > Run > cmd or Start > Run > powershell

<p>3. Install `pipenv` (if not already installed):</p>

```
pip3 install pipenv
or
pip install pipenv
```
<p>4. Install dependencies in a virtual envioronment:</p>

```
pipenv install
```

<p>5. Activate the virtual environment:</p>

```
pipenv shell
```

<p>5. Run the Garmin browser login once:</p>

```
python3 garmin_browser_login.py
or
python garmin_browser_login.py
```

<p>This opens a Chromium browser window. Log in to Garmin Connect normally, including MFA if prompted. The script saves reusable Garmin tokens to the local <code>.garth</code> directory, because direct username/password login through Garth no longer reliably works with Garmin's current auth flow.</p>
  
<p>6. Choose your backup folder.</p>

<p>7. Run the script when you're done riding or running.</p>

```
python3 myWhoosh2Garmin.py
or
python myWhoosh2Garmin.py
```

<p>Optional: use Zwift-like FIT device metadata before upload:</p>

```
python3 myWhoosh2Garmin.py --fix-device
or
python myWhoosh2Garmin.py --fix-device
```

<p>This changes the exported FIT creator metadata to look more like a Zwift virtual ride by setting the FIT manufacturer to Zwift and adding creator device information.</p>

<p>Example output:</p>

<h2>ℹ️ Automation tips</h2> 

What if you want to automate the whole process:
<h3>MacOS</h3>

PowerShell on MacOS (Verified & works)

You need Powershell

```shell
brew install powershell/tap/powershell
```

```powershell
# Define the JSON config file path
$configFile = "$PSScriptRoot\mywhoosh_config.json"
$myWhooshApp = "myWhoosh Indoor Cycling App.app"

# Check if the JSON file exists and read the stored path
if (Test-Path $configFile) {
    $config = Get-Content -Path $configFile | ConvertFrom-Json
    $mywhooshPath = $config.path
} else {
    $mywhooshPath = $null
}

# Validate the stored path
if (-not $mywhooshPath -or -not (Test-Path $mywhooshPath)) {
    Write-Host "Searching for $myWhooshApp"
    $mywhooshPath = Get-ChildItem -Path "/Applications" -Filter $myWhooshApp -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -First 1

    if (-not $mywhooshPath) {
        Write-Host " not found!"
        exit 1
    }

    $mywhooshPath = $mywhooshPath.FullName

    # Store the path in the JSON file
    $config = @{ path = $mywhooshPath }
    $config | ConvertTo-Json | Set-Content -Path $configFile
}

Write-Host "Found $myWhooshApp at $mywhooshPath"

Start-Process -FilePath $mywhooshPath

# Wait for the application to finish
Write-Host "Waiting for $myWhooshApp to finish..."
while ($process = ps -ax | grep -i $myWhooshApp | grep -v "grep") {
    Write-Output $process
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
}

# Run the Python script
Write-Host "$myWhooshApp has finished, running Python script..."
python3 "<PATH_WHERE_YOUR_SCRIPT_IS_LOCATED>/MyWhoosh2Garmin/myWhoosh2Garmin.py"
```

AppleScript (need to test further)

```applescript
TODO: needs more work
```

<h3>Windows</h3>

Windows .ps1 (PowerShell) file (Untested on Windows)
```powershell
# Define the JSON config file path
$configFile = "$PSScriptRoot\mywhoosh_config.json"

# Check if the JSON file exists and read the stored path
if (Test-Path $configFile) {
    $config = Get-Content -Path $configFile | ConvertFrom-Json
    $mywhooshPath = $config.path
} else {
    $mywhooshPath = $null
}

# Validate the stored path
if (-not $mywhooshPath -or -not (Test-Path $mywhooshPath)) {
    Write-Host "Searching for mywhoosh.exe..."
    $mywhooshPath = Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\PROGRAM FILES" -Filter "mywhoosh.exe" -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -First 1

    if (-not $mywhooshPath) {
        Write-Host "mywhoosh.exe not found!"
        exit 1
    }

    $mywhooshPath = $mywhooshPath.FullName

    # Store the path in the JSON file
    $config = @{ path = $mywhooshPath }
    $config | ConvertTo-Json | Set-Content -Path $configFile
}

Write-Host "Found mywhoosh.exe at $mywhooshPath"

# Start mywhoosh.exe
Start-Process -FilePath $mywhooshPath

# Wait for the application to finish
Write-Host "Waiting for mywhoosh to finish..."
while (Get-Process -Name "mywhoosh" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
}

# Run the Python script
Write-Host "mywhoosh has finished, running Python script..."
python "C:\Path\to\myWhoosh2Garmin.py"
```
